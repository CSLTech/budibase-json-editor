# Description
Budibase JSON Editor Plugin.

Find out more about [Budibase](https://github.com/Budibase/budibase).

This plugin is based on https://github.com/josdejong/svelte-jsoneditor

The built-in JSON typed field from budibase is fairly limited and has some very weird quirks. This brings a better JSON editor to budibase.


## Instructions

Simply install the plugin and use is as you would any other string form field.
